# Koii-Uptime-Tracker
Koii Uptime Tracker
This PowerShell script monitors the Koii Node process, tracks its uptime, CPU load, and memory usage, and logs this data to a file. Here’s what it does:

Main Features:
Ensures Execution Policy:

Sets the execution policy to RemoteSigned for the current user to allow the script to run.
Creates Necessary Log Folders:

The script ensures that the uptime directory exists at:
C:\Users\gap\AppData\Roaming\KOII-Desktop-Node\uptime
If the directory doesn’t exist, it is created.
Tracks Uptime & Monthly Uptime:

Stores total uptime in uptime_data.json.
Tracks monthly uptime separately in monthly_uptime.json.
Monitors Koii Node Process:

Scans running processes for any related to Koii.
Retrieves process details such as:
Start time
CPU load
Memory usage
Calculates total uptime by adding previous uptime if the process restarts.
Updates the log file (uptime_log.txt) with the latest uptime data.
Handles Log File Size:

Keeps only the last 2000 entries to prevent excessive log file growth.
Highlights Important Tasks:

Looks for specific task names (like "SMART Task", "KPL token Miner", "Reverie Field Compute", etc.) in the command line.
Hides Certain Information (Per Your Request):

The executable path is commented out.
The command-line details are commented out.
Runs Continuously:

The script runs in an infinite loop (while ($true)) and checks every hour.
